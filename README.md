Code to reproduce all figures in the paper:
"High-dimensional dynamics in low-dimensional networks"
by Yue Wan and Robert Rosenbaum

Each .py file contains a script to generate the associated figure. Figures are saved into the Figure folder. In some cases, data is saved in the data folder.

The code relies on the python packages: numpy, torch, matplotlib, seaborn, and time

Detailed python package requirements are contained in requirements.txt

To generate a figure, just run the associated .py file.

Please contact Robert Rosenbaum if you have any questions about the code.
