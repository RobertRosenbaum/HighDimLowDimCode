Code to reproduce all figures in the paper:
"High-dimensional dynamics in low-dimensional networks"
by Yue Wan and Robert Rosenbaum

Each .py file contains a script to generate the associated figure. Figures are saved into the Figure folder. In some cases, data is saved in the data folder.

Please contact Robert Rosenbaum if you have any questions about the code.
